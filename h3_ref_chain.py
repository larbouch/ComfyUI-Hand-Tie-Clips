"""Native MiniMax H3 Ref2VA chain: several generates joined into one clip.

Hop 1 is a full Ref2VA generate and may carry an official six-field H3 prompt.
Hop 2+ is a *continuation*, not a second generate: a continuation beat with the
previous hop pinned in front of it.

The pin is the whole point. Hop 2+ slices the previous hop's sampler AV latent
through MiniMaxH3MotionContext, which keeps the join in the latent domain and
end-aligns the audio window. MiniMaxH3AddGuide on decoded pixels is the
fallback -- taken when Motion-Context is missing, or when the previous hop came
from the cache and so has no sampler latent to slice.

Authoring is `shot_plan` + `ref_plan`, both JSON strings, both edited by the DOM
panel in js/ and both the single source of truth. The legacy `prompt` widget
(optional --- / JSON blocks) still runs for `hop_script=verbatim`.

    hook, so every lever has to be applied to the latent before it goes in.

    Two rescale modes, and the difference between them is the whole point.

    `sigma` rescales the pin so its standard deviation matches the anchor hop's.
    This is the original lever and **it is measurably the wrong statistic.** On
    a 3-hop chain the pin's total sigma FELL (1.0414 -> 1.0289) while the
    picture's mid-band energy climbed 8% and its high-band fraction rose 1.6%.
    Matching sigma there scales the whole latent UP by 1.2%, lifting a high
    band that was already too hot. Kept because it is what shipped, and old
    workflows say "on".

    `band` splits each spatial component into low and high and rescales only the
    high part, so the *ratio* between them returns to the anchor hop's. That
    ratio is what the ratchet actually moves. Still a scalar per band, so it
    moves no structure and cannot blur or invent detail -- the property that

    predict is Motion-Context raising at call time, which the caller catches by
    comparing this against the mechanism actually used and declining to cache
    that hop.

    `mode` is the `pin_mech` widget. "auto" is the shipped behaviour and the
    four conditions below. Forcing does not add a fifth condition -- it removes
    them, which is the point: a forced setting that quietly degrades to the
    other mechanism tells you nothing, and the reason to force one is to
    compare it against the other. The two chain-wide preconditions are
    validated before any sampling starts, so the only one that can still be
    false here is the per-hop latent.

# NOTHING AUTO-DETECTS. A ModelPatcher carries no name -- `_model_fingerprint`
# returns a content hash of the patched weight keys and the attention scalars,
# which can tell two checkpoints apart but cannot tell you either one is
# distilled. So the mode is DECLARED by the person on the rail, and the log
# prints the fingerprint beside it so a run can be attributed afterwards.
#
# `regular` is empty by construction -- the widgets, untouched -- so a graph
# built before this widget existed renders byte-identically.
#
# `turbo` is a distilled few-step base, and the honest state of that row is that
# MOST OF IT IS UNMEASURED. What is measured, on matched runs at a pinned seed,
# is that a turbo base is the degrader: junction MAE 8.40-10.85 and climbing hop
# over hop, against 2.07-4.02 flat for the plain hybrid over 9-10 hops. The
# turbo checkpoint went into the BASE loader only and the chain still collapsed,
# so it compounds through the conditioning path and not through the latent, and
# there is no corner of this loop where turbo is free. The preset does not claim
# to fix that.
#
# The row is ONE entry, refine_align=hop_tail: `denoise` builds an INDEPENDENT
# grid --
# int(steps/denoise) steps, keep the last steps+1 -- so the published 2/0.50 is
# the tail of a 4-step grid whatever the hop sampled, and its closing stride
# (0.8 -> 0) is wider in sigma than any step an 8-step hop takes. A distilled
# trunk is only accurate at the sigmas it was distilled for, so that stride is
# off-manifold by construction on exactly the bases this row is for; hop_tail
# re-runs the hop's own last sigmas instead, at identical cost.
#
# It belongs in the row and not in the default because the failure it fixes is
# a property of the BASE, not of the era's sampler fashion: an undistilled trunk
# is accurate everywhere, so `denoise` is fine there and stays the default --
# which also means a 2.1 graph reloads on the schedule it rendered under. That
# base-vs-fashion line is the whole admission test for this table: sampler,
# scheduler and step count are turbo-community fashion, they turn over every
# release, and a stamping preset that moved them would overwrite a choice the
# user made. They are deliberately absent and are not coming back.

# explicit that a seam measurement is corroboration, never the decision. The
# better reading is that freeze was compensating for the bug above: with
# `denoise` the refine entered hops 2+ at an off-grid sigma, so not refining the
# head was the lesser harm. hop_tail removes the cause, and the only end-to-end
# turbo evidence in this project -- a 7-hop chain on a turbo merge, hop_tail
# with refine_head=refine -- came out clean where the unrefined arm was crunchy.

    """Hold the pinned overlap head, the audio stream, or both, out of the
    refine.

    Measured, not assumed. On an 8x8-pooled (geometry-only) frame difference a
    stock chain's joins are indistinguishable from ordinary motion -- 1.00x
    against its own neighbourhood. Every refine mode puts them at 2.4-2.8x, and
    the size does NOT track refine_denoise: 0.20 measures 2.75x and 0.50
    measures 2.41x. Texture moves far less (0.94x -> 1.4-1.6x), so what the
    refine breaks at the join is position, not grain. What is constant across
    those runs is that the head goes through an extra, independently-noised pass
    that the tail it has to continue never saw.

    THE RAMP LIVES INSIDE THE HEAD. The head is exactly the region the writer
    discards -- `incoming = imgs[drop_n:]` -- so latent step `v_steps` is the
    FIRST DELIVERED frame. Ramping forward from there puts a partial denoise on
    the first delivered frames of every hop, which is a texture dent precisely
    at the seam. The ramp climbs across the last steps OF the head instead, so
    the mask is already 1.0 by the time it reaches a frame anyone sees. Ramping
    on the delivered side is `refine_blend`'s job, and it does it on finished
    samples where it cannot dent anything.

    AUDIO IS HELD WHOLE, AND ON EVERY HOP. Leaving audio live while the video
    head was frozen produced a strained voice at the end of each hop; mirroring
    the video mask into the audio head made it worse. The defect is not WHICH
    audio is refined, it is that the audio stream acquires a BOUNDARY at all --
    at 40 Hz a latent step is 25 ms, and a magnitude jump between a held region
    and a refined one is audible as a warble. Holding it only on hops 2+ fixes
    nothing audible either: hop 1's voice is what every later hop's context pin
    continues, so the damage is applied once and then carried. Hence the audio
    hold is gated separately from the head hold and applies to hop 1 too.

    noise_mask polarity is 1 = denoise, 0 = freeze. ANDs with whatever mask is
    already there -- under master_audio_file that is the audio lock, and
    replacing it would hand the refine a live audio stream to re-cook.

    Returns (latent, v_steps, audio_held). v_steps is 0 when no head was frozen,
    which is not an error: hop 1 has no pinned head and an off-grid overlap has
    no whole number of latent steps. Audio can still be held in both of those
    cases, so callers must test both halves of the result.

    Every ratchet lever before this one acts at the join and acts by arithmetic:
    `pin_renorm` rescales a statistic, `pin_mech=reset` blends bands of a warped
    photograph. The measured failure was always the same -- the statistics held
    while the CONTENT walked -- and arithmetic cannot put content back.
    Re-sampling can, because it runs the model. That is the whole reason this
    exists and the reason it sits here rather than at the join.

    `align` picks WHERE on the noise curve those model evals land, and it is the
    whole of the turbo story.

    `denoise` is the original path and builds an INDEPENDENT schedule:
    `BasicScheduler(steps, denoise)` asks for `int(steps/denoise)` steps and
    keeps the last `steps+1`. At the published 2 / 0.50 / shift 12 that is the
    tail of a FOUR-step grid, `[0.9231, 0.8000, 0]`. But the hop was sampled on
    an EIGHT-step grid, `[1.0, .9882, .9730, .9524, .9231, .8780, .8, .6316,
    0]`. The two grids share only their endpoints. The refine re-enters at the
    hop's step-4 sigma and then takes two strides where the hop took four --
    and its closing stride is `0.8 -> 0`, a jump 27% larger in sigma than any
    step the hop itself ever took. On a plain base that reads as the documented
    "deliberately under-converged" texture pass. On a turbo LoRA or merge it is
    a different thing entirely: a few-step distillation is only accurate AT the
    sigmas it was distilled for, so an off-grid stride of that size is taken by
    a model that was never trained to take it, from a state it was never shown.
    That is the misalignment -- not the number of evals, and not `s0`, which a
    LoRA does not move at all (the sigma transform comes from `shift_video`,
    and a LoRA does not touch `model_sampling`).

    `hop_tail` -- the default -- fixes it by construction rather than by
    tuning: the refine simply RE-RUNS THE HOP'S OWN LAST `steps` SIGMAS.
    `refine_steps=2` against that 8-step hop gives `[0.8, 0.6316, 0]` -- same
    two evals, same cost, every one of them on the grid the trunk was distilled
    for, and the closing stride is exactly the hop's own closing stride. It
    needs no re-tuning when the base changes, because it is DERIVED from
    whatever schedule the base is running; swap turbo for plain, or 8 steps for
    4, and the refine follows. `refine_denoise` is unused here and the log says
    so.

    `denoise` is kept so an archived run reproduces bit-for-bit.

    The schedule is cached under a ("refine", steps, denoise, scheduler) tuple.
    The hop schedules are cached under a bare int, so the two can never collide
    -- which matters more than it looks: a collision would hand the refine pass
    the hop's full-denoise schedule and quietly re-render the hop from noise.
    `scheduler` is in the key because refine_scheduler can differ from the hop's:
    without it, flipping simple/sgm_uniform mid-chain would be served the first
    one's sigmas and the widget would do nothing. `hop_tail` needs none of that
    -- it slices a schedule that already exists.
