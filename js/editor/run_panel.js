/**
 * The run panel: every dial that is not per-shot, grouped and labelled.
 *
 * The shot cards made the *script* legible and left the other twenty-odd
 * widgets stacked underneath as a wall of raw controls, in definition order,
 * with no grouping -- so the node read as "a polished editor, then a heap".
 * The dials with the least obvious semantics (`pin_renorm`, `pin_noise`,
 * `cache_budget_gb`) were indistinguishable from the ones nobody touches.
 *
 * Same contract as the shot editor: this is a RENDERING LAYER over the native
 * widgets, never a second source of truth. Every control writes straight back
 * to `widget.value` and fires the widget's own callback, so the workflow JSON
 * is byte-identical to one produced by the stock UI, and anything this panel
 * cannot express is still reachable by dropping it from the group list.
 *
 * Help text comes from the `tooltip` written in INPUT_TYPES, via
 * `tooltipFor()`. Retyping those sentences here would be a second copy that
 * goes stale, for exactly the reason routes.py exists. Reading only
 * `widget.options.tooltip` was not enough and left the whole panel with no
 * tooltips at all while the native dials kept theirs -- see tooltipFor().
