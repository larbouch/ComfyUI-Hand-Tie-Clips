 * The fifth entry is the widget PREFIX of the trim window, or null for a slot
 * that cannot be trimmed. A still has no duration, so the first frame has none;
 * the other three each own a `<prefix>_start_s` / `<prefix>_end_s` pair.
 *
 * A trim prefix ending in `*` is a FIXED-WIDTH window: it owns a
 * `<prefix>_start_s` and no `_end_s`, because its width is not a choice the
 * user gets to make. Master audio is the only one -- the window is the chain
 * (duration x shots - overlap), so an OUT grip would be a control that does
 * nothing. See `createTrimBar`'s `span`.
 *
 * The sixth is a description widget, or null. Only the reference clip has one:
 * a picture in the rail carries its own `desc`, and the clip had nowhere to say
 * what it was for -- so it went to the encoder as <Video 1> with nothing naming
 * it, which is the same uncited-reference problem the stills had. */
