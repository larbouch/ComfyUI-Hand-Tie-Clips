"""Keyframed blend between the raw and the refined copy of one hop's latent.

The refine pass re-samples a finished hop at low denoise. Taken whole, its
output is what ships and what the next hop continues -- and the head of the hop
is exactly the region that has to continue the PREVIOUS hop, which was never
put through a second sampler. That mismatch is the measured seam cost: on an
8x8-pooled geometry difference a stock chain's joins sit at 1.00x its own
ordinary motion and a fully refined chain puts them at 2.4-2.8x.

xyzdist's `H3BlendLatents` answers it by not taking the refine whole: the
delivered latent is a per-frame lerp from the raw sample to the refined one,
`0:0, 22:0, 44:1` -- raw across the pinned overlap, crossing to fully refined
22 frames later. This module is that ramp, with one bug fixed.

**His node derives the ramp position from a `duration` widget.** It computes
`pixel_total_frames = int(round(duration * fps))` and then
`ratio = total_frames / pixel_total_frames`, so the widget is what says where
frame 22 lives on the latent grid. Set it to 5 on an 8 s render and every
keyframe lands in the wrong place, silently -- no error, just a ramp somewhere
else. Nothing needs to be typed: the latent knows how many steps it has and the
caller knows how many frames the hop is.

It is also not a uniform ratio. H3's video tokens cover `(1, 4, 4, 4, 4)`
frames on a repeating cycle, so 22 frames take 7 latent steps and 44 take 13 and
a quarter, not `22 * T/length` of the way along. `step_for_frame` walks the real
cycle -- the same walk the backup's `_video_steps_for_frames` does, which maps
5/22/39/56 to 2/7/12/17 -- so `0:0, 22:0, 44:1` comes out as latent steps
7.00 -> 13.25, which is the 7-13 band the published run was ramping over.

No ComfyUI imports, for the reason `latents.py`, `plan.py` and `tone.py` have
none: the arithmetic here decides which frames ship raw, and it should be
checkable without a GPU, a server, or a model on disk.
