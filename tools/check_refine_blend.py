r"""Offline tests for the refine blend ramp -- no server, no model, no GPU.

    D:\ComfyUI\venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_refine_blend.py

The ramp decides which frames of every hop ship the raw sample and which ship
the refined one. Get it wrong by a couple of latent steps and the seam is
refined after all -- which is the exact failure the blend exists to avoid, and
it is invisible in the log, in the console and in a still frame. It only shows
up as a geometry step at the join, three hops later, mixed in with everything
else being tested that day.

So the arithmetic is asserted against hand-computed values here, where it costs
a second. The one that matters most is the `duration` bug in the node this is
ported from: his ramp position is read off a widget, and this file's job is to
prove ours is read off the latent.
