r"""Offline tests for master_audio_file -- no server, no model, no GPU.

    D:\ComfyUI\venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_audio_lock.py

An off-by-one in the hop window costs 42 ms per hop and compounds. An
inverted noise_mask freezes the picture and generates a new voice. Neither
is visible to any other checker. This file is the table those two cannot
hide from.

The window function is pure and has no ComfyUI import. The widget and
cache-key claims need the node, so those run after a pack load.

    mask on the wrong stream generates a voice over a frozen picture, and a
    video component that does not come back bit-identical is a silently
    different render.

    The shapes here are read off a real cached hop rather than invented --
    video [1, 24, T, H/16, W/16] and audio [1, 32, 2, T40] -- because a fixture
    that does not match production is not a test. That is not a hypothetical:
    check_latent_sidecar built its noise_mask as a plain tensor where the code
    makes a NestedTensor, passed, and the hop cache was silently off for every
    locked hop until somebody read a log line (DEVLOG 63).
