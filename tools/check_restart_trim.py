r"""Offline tests for restart hops writing full length -- no GPU.

    D:\ComfyUI\venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_restart_trim.py

A restart is a chain start. It overlaps with nothing, so dropping the
leading 22 frames throws away 0.9 s of new content per restart, and the
preallocation `sum(lengths) - overlap * (n - 1)` sizes the master short
by the same amount. Two restarts on the tester's 9 x 8 s chain is 44
frames / 1.83 s of silence at the end, or an overrun raise.

The audio-lock window has to move with it: a restart that kept the
uniform stride would freeze lips to a take 0.9 s earlier than the
picture.
