r"""Offline tests for the LLM plan writer -- no server, no model, no GPU.

    D:\ComfyUI\venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_planner.py

The repair loop is the reason the Write-plan button is worth having, and it is
also the part that cannot be checked by looking at it. `planner.write_plan`
takes its completion function as an argument precisely so this file can drive it
with a scripted model: one reply carrying a known fault, then a clean one. If
attempt 2 does not fix attempt 1's mistake, that is a failure here rather than a
surprise in front of a user with a 27B loaded.

The planted fault is the real one. The A/B run that chose the shipped prompt had
two unrelated model families both write a beat citing `@kitchen` while the
register declared only the people -- so `resolve_tags` raised and the queue
stopped. That is the fault attempt 1 makes below.

Covers:
  * split_reply     -- structured output, two fences, one bare object
  * validate        -- accepts a good plan; catches the tag mismatch, a bad
                       duration label, an invented filename, a hop-count miss,
                       a missing subject box, a rail tag the model dropped
  * write_plan      -- repairs on attempt 2, reports warnings, and never
                       returns an unvalidated plan when it cannot converge;
                       a pinned rail locks tags; stills ride only attempt 1
  * unload_all      -- the killswitch refuses to evict a writer that is not on
                       this machine, without opening a connection to find out
  * free_for_render -- quiet when unconfigured; does not raise from inside a
                       running event loop (ComfyUI's async execute path)
