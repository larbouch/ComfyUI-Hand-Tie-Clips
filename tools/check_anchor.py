r"""Offline tests for anchor=restart -- no server, no model, no GPU.

    D:\ComfyUI\venv\Scripts\python.exe tools\check_anchor.py

`anchor: "restart"` makes a hop a chain start: the start image becomes its
frame 0 and nothing from the previous hop is relayed into it. It exists because
a chain decays by inheritance -- every hop is conditioned on its predecessor's
last frames, which are its most settled, so motion and lighting response fade
the further in you go (DEVLOG 51).

Its three guard rules shipped broken TWICE before anything tested them: once
naming a `join` value the vocabulary does not contain, once reading
`start_image` before it was assigned. Both failed on a real queue. Guards that
only a render exercises are guards nobody has run.
