"""One read-only endpoint: the vocabulary the editor draws its dropdowns from.

The alternative is a copy of `VOCAB` in JavaScript, and a copy is a second source
of truth that goes stale the first time a phrase is improved. `directives.py`
exists precisely so that improving a sentence improves every plan ever written;
duplicating those strings in the UI would undo that.

It also ships the *prose* each option compiles to, not just the option names, so
the editor can show what a directive actually puts in front of the encoder. That
is the whole answer to "I don't know how any of this works at a glance".

Since 2026-08-28 this module also carries the reference *files*: `POST
/h3_ref_chain/upload` streams dropped media into `<input>/h3_refs`, and `GET
/h3_ref_chain/files` lists what is there. Those replaced the nine `ref_image_N`
IMAGE sockets, which were most of a 16-socket column.

Everything that decides *where bytes land* lives in `media.py`, not here: one
prefix-checked resolver used by both the route and the loaders, so there is a
single place to be wrong about it. The route itself never joins a path.

Since 2026-08-30 it also carries the optional plan writer: `GET/POST
/h3_ref_chain/llm` reads and saves the local chat-server settings, and `POST
/h3_ref_chain/plan` runs the generate-validate-repair loop in `planner.py`.
Those are the only places in the pack that touch the network, and none of them
is reachable from a graph execution -- the button writes JSON into a widget,
and queueing reads the widget. `llm` and `planner` are imported inside the
handlers rather than at module scope so a broken or absent aiohttp client
cannot stop the pack from loading.
