"""Have a language model write a plan, then make it fix its own mistakes.

`prompt_pack/README.md` has always told people to close this loop by hand:

    If the node rejects the plan, paste the error straight back into the chat --
    every message names the shot or reference it came from, and one round trip
    usually fixes it.

That instruction is the whole feature. The node already carries validators whose
messages were written to be read, and the A/B run that chose the shipped prompt
proved the need: two unrelated model families made the same `@tag` mismatch, and
one round trip fixed both. This module does that round trip automatically.

The important design property is that `validate()` is **pure and synchronous**
and `write_plan()` takes its completion function as an argument. Together those
mean the repair loop can be tested with a scripted fake model and no server --
which is the only way it gets tested at all, in the tradition of
`tools/check_features.py`. A loop that has never demonstrably repaired anything
is a loop nobody should trust.

`validate()` deliberately re-runs the *real* checkers rather than describing the
rules a second time. A second copy of the rules is a second thing to get wrong,
and the whole point is that what passes here is what the node accepts.
